                    Born and raised in Los Angeles, California to now living in beautiful Arizona. I decided to move and work as medical assistant. I been working for a pain management clinic for almost 6 years. I decided that it was time for a carreer change and so I decided to join the full-stack web development boot camp that University of Arizona offers.
